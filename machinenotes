Machine learning algorithms:

1. Supervised Learning: the idea is that we are going to teach the computer what is going to learn

2. Unsupervised Learning: and in unsupervised learning we will let it to do it by yourself.

3. Reinforcement learning, recommender systems is also the type of ML algorithms.
